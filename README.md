In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data by visualizing key features and identifying insights that may influence survival.

Key Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
